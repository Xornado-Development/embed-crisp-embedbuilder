# An embed visualizer

Visualize embed or message content from JSON input or provided GUI editor.

This can be used for bot embed commands. Not everyone understands JSON, thus GUI.  
You can look into the [project boards](https://github.com/Glitchii/embedbuilder/projects/3) if you want to see what is being worked on or want to contribute.
